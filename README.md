# Experis Financial Data Mart - BI Project
Project in BI Systems Development course at Experis Academy. 

This project is dedicated to crafting a comprehensive BI solution created for Experis's HR & Finance departments, featuring a data mart and reports developed in Power BI.

## Project Overview
### Project Specifications: 
Planning the data mart and reports, including crafting essential documents like [ERD](https://drawsql.app/teams/bi-developer-course-experis-academy/diagrams/financepayrolldb). 
These artifacts provided the foundational blueprint for subsequent development phases.

### Data Mart Development: 
The Data Mart creation will be done using data derived from the billing operational system database ( ExperisBillings), and it will include summarized data tables, focusing on the Company's customers, employees, departments ( Cyber, BI, Sales, etc.), and financial data.

### Power BI Reports: 
This phase involved creating another table - Dates, calculated columns, and measures using DAX to support the envisioned visualizations and, subsequently, proceeding to craft and design the visualizations.

1 Dashboard and 4 Reports were created: 
* Customers Invoices & Employees Payrolls Dashboard
* Customer Report
* Customers Details And Billing Rate Report
* Employees Payrolls Report
* Employees Details Report
